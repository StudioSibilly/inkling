# Inkling

Partial implementation of the `Ink` markup language for branching game stories 
and dialogue in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

`Ink` is a creation of [Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/). For more information
about the language, [see their website](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

This book is a user's guide to the language. It is written with the intent to be a mostly
friendly and accessible explanation of getting it up and running. The more advanced 
documentation of the API is available at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/inkling).
