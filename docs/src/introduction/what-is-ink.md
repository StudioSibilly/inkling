# What is Ink?

`Ink` is a scripting language created by game developer [Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/) 
to use in their many narrative driven games, including [80 Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/), 
[Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/) 
and [Pendragon](https://www.inklestudios.com/pendragon/). 

It is designed to make it easy to write a script in regular text files, without the need 
for complicated tools (although Inkle does provide [such tools](https://www.github.com/inkle/inky/releases/latest)). 
Since their games are narrative heavy, with dialogue and paths which change as the player
moves through them, it has excellent support for branching the story into different parts.
All this while still being very easy to read.

More information about the language can be found on [Inkle's web site](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).
This includes several tutorials for getting familiar with both basic and advanced 
features of the language.
