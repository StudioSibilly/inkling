This chapter contains a list of the `ink` features which are available in `inkling`.

More information about these features can be found in 
[Inkle's guide to writing with Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md),
which is a better guide showing how to write a script. 

However, not everything in that guide can be done with `inkling`, since it is not
completely compatible with the original implementation. This is partly 
the reason for this document, which shows which features are *guaranteed* to work.

Examples in this chapter show how the features are written in plain `.ink` 
text files (although the file names do not have to end with `.ink`). Text inside of 
these files will appear like this:

```plain
Example text in a file to be read.
